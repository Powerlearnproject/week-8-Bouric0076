Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty

Problem Definition

 1. Context and Background: 
Poverty remains a persistent global issue, affecting millions of individuals and communities worldwide. Effective financial management is critical in alleviating poverty by helping individuals and families make informed decisions about their resources. Many people in poverty struggle with understanding and managing their finances due to a lack of tools and knowledge.

 2. Specific Problem: 
The primary issue addressed by this project is the lack of efficient financial management tools for low-income individuals or communities. Without a structured way to track and analyze their financial activities, people may find it challenging to budget, save, and allocate resources effectively, exacerbating their financial difficulties.

 3. Solution Approach: 
The project leverages an  Expense Tracker  as a data-driven solution to address this problem. The expense tracker will enable users to:
- Record and categorize their income and expenses.
- Track spending patterns and savings over time.
- Identify areas of financial strain and opportunities for cost-saving.

 4. Objectives: 
-  Enhance Financial Awareness:  Provide users with insights into their spending habits and financial status.
-  Promote Informed Decision-Making:  Help users make better financial decisions to optimize their resources.
-  Reduce Financial Strain:  Enable users to identify and reduce unnecessary expenditures.

 5. Expected Impact: 
By using the expense tracker, individuals and communities will gain a clearer understanding of their financial situation, leading to improved budgeting and savings practices. This, in turn, contributes to poverty alleviation by helping users manage their finances more effectively and make strategic decisions that can improve their economic well-being.
